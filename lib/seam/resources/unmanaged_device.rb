  module Resources
    # Represents an [unmanaged device](https://docs.seam.co/core-concepts/devices/managed-and-unmanaged-devices). An unmanaged device has a limited set of visible properties and a subset of supported events. You cannot control an unmanaged device. Any [access codes](https://docs.seam.co/low-level-apis/smart-locks/access-codes/migrating-existing-access-codes) on an unmanaged device are unmanaged. To control an unmanaged device with Seam, [convert it to a managed device](https://docs.seam.co/core-concepts/devices/managed-and-unmanaged-devices#convert-an-unmanaged-device-to-managed).

      # Collection of capabilities that the device supports when connected to Seam. Values are `access_code`, which indicates that the device can manage and utilize digital PIN codes for secure access; `lock`, which indicates that the device controls a door locking mechanism, enabling the remote opening and closing of doors and other entry points; `noise_detection`, which indicates that the device supports monitoring and responding to ambient noise levels; `thermostat`, which indicates that the device can regulate and adjust indoor temperatures; `battery`, which indicates that the device can manage battery life and health; and `phone`, which indicates that the device is a mobile device, such as a smartphone. **Important:** Superseded by [capability flags](https://docs.seam.co/capability-guides/device-and-system-capabilities#capability-flags).
